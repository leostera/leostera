## Hi there, I'm Leandro ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and product manager, currently PMing the OCaml Platform at Tarides.

But since this is Github, I'll focus on the code.

I enjoy writing functional programming languages like Erlang, Elixir, OCaml, ReScript, and Rust. And I've used them to write all sorts of software in the last decade: data pipelines, distributed systems, WYSIWIG editors, compilers, dev tools, and all sorts of SaaS stuff.

In the past I've worked at companies like Klarna and Spotify, and many startups.

Some of my notable work is:

* [Caramel](https://github.com/leostera/caramel) â€“ a compiler to run OCaml on the Erlang VM
* [Riot](https://github.com/riot-ml/riot) â€“ an Erlang-style runtime for OCaml
* [tldr.jsx](https://github.com/leostera/tld.jsx) â€“ the first official tldr-pages project web client (now deprecated)
